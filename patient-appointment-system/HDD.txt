High Level Design for Patient Appointment Management System

1. Overview:
   The Patient Appointment Management System is a web-based application that allows healthcare providers to manage patient records and appointments efficiently. The system consists of a frontend (user interface), backend (API and business logic), and a database.

2. Main Components:
   a. Frontend (patient-appointment-system/frontend):
      - Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.
      - Provides user interfaces for dashboard, patient management, appointment scheduling, and booking.
      - Communicates with backend APIs to fetch and update data.

   b. Backend (patient-appointment-system/backend):
      - RESTful API built with a framework such as Node.js/Express or Python/Flask.
      - Handles authentication, business logic, and data validation.
      - Exposes endpoints for patients, appointments, and user management.

   c. Database:
      - Stores patient records, appointment details, and user information.
      - Can use relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) database.

3. Key Features:
   - User authentication and authorization.
   - Patient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   - Appointment scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation.
   - Dashboard with statistics and quick actions.
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

4. Folder Structure:
   patient-appointment-system/
   ├── backend/
   │   ├── app.js / main.py
   │   ├── routes/
   │   ├── models/
   │   └── controllers/
   ├── frontend/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   ├── css/
   │   └── js/
   └── database/
       └── schema.sql / models.js

5. Data Flow:
   - User interacts with the frontend.
   - Frontend sends requests to backend API.
   - Backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses.
   - Frontend updates the UI based on API responses.

6. Security Considerations:
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Implement authentication (e.g., JWT tokens).
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

7. Scalability:
   - Modular backend and frontend code for easy maintenance.
   - Database indexing for efficient queries.
   - Option to deploy using Docker or cloud services.
